## :wave: Howdy! My name is Ryan Thaut.

**I'm a self-employed enterprise cloud consultant/developer and small business web guru located in Wyoming.**

Here on GitHub, my main **public side-project repositories** are browser extensions, such as [YouTube Popout Player](https://github.com/rthaut/YouTubePopoutPlayer) and [DeviantArt Filter](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter), as well as some tools and packages I have developed over the years for building better browser extensions.
